DosGamesFinder todo list

Minisprint
- Backbone - Set up the navigation to read genres from the Genre collections
- Backbone - Create new Views for screenshots and download locations, for use with DetailView
- Backbone - Set up our DetailView to read off the API and sync to data returned by the DetailView Serializer. 

Minisprint
- Scrape some data from an online source so that we can test with a larger data set
- Write some code to convert this scraped data into database entries, we won't manually enter this of course

Minisprint
- Backbone - Test that during our DosGame model initilization, since our template will read some JSON data, it needs to ensure that if no data is returned by API, then some placeholder information takes its place.

After initial deployment
- Look at using QUnit to develop our unit tests for our Backbone code
- If we haven't already, write some functional tests 
- Customize the admin so that creation of Dosgames allows for Screenshots and Download location additions
- Customize the admin so that slugs are automatically generated
- Implement some caching
- Figure out how to disable the API browser when visting the page in a web browser, perhaps even just have it re-direct. 
- Re-factor the API so that it requries a user to login
- Implement throttling and look at locust.io to do load testing (not just for load balancing, but to test API throttling too)
