DosGamesFinder todo list

A few tidying up features:
- Set up the cards so that they are uniform in vertical size, note that the image and description both seem to influence this. Cut off excess description with ... or [more]
- Figure out why the app is so slow! Maybe we need some pagination?
- create a proper 'screenshot not found' placeholder image 
- do some testing, any bugs to address before intial deployment? 

Deployment tasks
- Install Fabric
- Create our FabFile

After initial deployment
- Implement the user rating system
- Implement the Publisher ListView and DetailView
- Implement a system for filtering all games by publisher
- Implement the year released filters and drop down menu
- Implement the search bar
- If we haven't already, write some functional tests 
- Look at the Backbone DosGameListViewRow view, it has some ugly code needed to split the games into multiple collections, can this be re-factored to be cleaner? 
- Customize the admin so that creation of Dosgames allows for Screenshots and Download location additions
- Customize the admin so that slugs are automatically generated
- Implement some caching
- Figure out how to disable the API browser when visting the page in a web browser, perhaps even just have it re-direct. 
- Re-factor the API so that it requries a user login even for read access. just to prevent scraping from bots, of course someone with some know-how will figure this out. 
- Implement throttling and look at locust.io to do load testing (not just for load balancing, but to test API throttling too)
- Look at using QUnit to develop our unit tests for our Backbone code
