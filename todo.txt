Model Layer:
- Refactor to not allow urls to access ID's directly, this allows for webscraping too easily. 

Backbone:
- Somehow implement the screenshots and download locations relationship in the Backbone models

After initial deployment
- Implement caching
- Figure out how to disable the API browser
- Re-factor the API so that it requries a user to login
- Look at locust.io to do load testing (not just for load balancing, but to test API throttling too)
