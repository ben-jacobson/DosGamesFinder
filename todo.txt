DosGamesFinder todo list

Next Sprint:
- what kind of string sanitization is DRF using? 
- Can we set up an animated page transition? eg a short fade when changing views
- Implement the search bar
- Figure out how to disable the API browser when visting the page in a web browser, perhaps even just have it re-direct. 
- Hook up adsense to page
- Can we refactor some of our router code by instead using events. eg the collection can fetch itself on a 'next_page' event

Next Sprint:
- Create a robots.txt file for site
- Create a sitemap.xml file for site
- Look at the Backbone DosGameListViewRow view, it has some ugly code needed to split the games into multiple collections, can this be re-factored to be cleaner? 
- Implement the user rating system
- Implement the year released filters and drop down menu
- Re-factor the API so that it requries a user login even for read access. just to prevent scraping from bots, of course someone with some know-how will figure this out. 
- Implement throttling and look at locust.io to do load testing (not just for load balancing, but to test API throttling too)

Next Sprint:
- Go back and write some functional tests, then set up Jenkins for CI
- Write some QUnit tests for Backbone 
- Implement caching
- Deploy code occasionally fails when updating settings.py SECRET_KEY. depending on what characters are used, will sometimes embed the new one within the old one. Must have to do with the regex pattern.
