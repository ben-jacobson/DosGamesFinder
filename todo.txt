DosGamesFinder todo list

View Layer - complete

Model Layer:
- Create a structure for creating game name slugs
- Create a get_absolute_url() method for the serializers to use if needed

Backbone:
- Refactor the Collections to take data from Django models and finish the rendering

After initial deployment
- Implement caching
- Figure out how to disable the API browser
- Re-factor the API so that it requries a user to login
- Look at locust.io to do load testing (not just for load balancing, but to test API throttling too)
