DosGamesFinder todo list

Current Sprint - 
- Register a domain for this
- Some games have hyperlinks in their descriptions. fix these (May be a manual job)
- Implement the genre filters

Next Sprint:
- Implement the Publisher ListView and DetailView
- Implement a system for filtering all games by publisher


Future Sprints - 
- Can we set up a page transition? eg a short fade when changing views
- Hook up adsense to page
- What meta tags do we have? Anything needed to improve SEO?
- Implement the user rating system
- Implement the year released filters and drop down menu
- Implement the search bar
- If we haven't already, write some functional tests 
- Look at the Backbone DosGameListViewRow view, it has some ugly code needed to split the games into multiple collections, can this be re-factored to be cleaner? 
- Customize the admin so that creation of Dosgames allows for Screenshots and Download location additions
- Customize the admin so that slugs are automatically generated
- Implement caching
- Figure out how to disable the API browser when visting the page in a web browser, perhaps even just have it re-direct. 
- Re-factor the API so that it requries a user login even for read access. just to prevent scraping from bots, of course someone with some know-how will figure this out. 
- Implement throttling and look at locust.io to do load testing (not just for load balancing, but to test API throttling too)
- Look at using QUnit to develop our unit tests for our Backbone code
- Go back and write some functional tests, then set up Jenkins for CI
