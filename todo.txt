DosGamesFinder todo list

Current Sprint:
- Server is currently caching html, during deployment, figure out how to clear this cache
- Implement the Publisher ListView and DetailView
- Implement a system for filtering all games by publisher
- There are some missing fabfile methods that need to be completed - mainly the backup database function

Future Sprints -
- In backbone index function, can we refactor these two items:
    - Create one route with an optional arugment, instead of two routes
    - instead of if page_number != null... , perhaps follow what we've got in filter_by_genre by setting to 1 if not defined.
- what kind of string sanitation is DRF using? 
- Can we set up a page transition? eg a short fade when changing views
- Hook up adsense to page
- What meta tags do we have? Anything needed to improve SEO?
- Implement the user rating system
- Implement the year released filters and drop down menu
- Implement the search bar
- If we haven't already, write some functional tests 
- Look at the Backbone DosGameListViewRow view, it has some ugly code needed to split the games into multiple collections, can this be re-factored to be cleaner? 
- Is there a more elegant way to handle pagination? Also some spaghetti code here
- Customize the admin so that creation of Dosgames allows for Screenshots and Download location additions
- Customize the admin so that slugs are automatically generated
- Customize the admin so as to paginate with long lists of results
- Implement caching
- Figure out how to disable the API browser when visting the page in a web browser, perhaps even just have it re-direct. 
- Re-factor the API so that it requries a user login even for read access. just to prevent scraping from bots, of course someone with some know-how will figure this out. 
- Implement throttling and look at locust.io to do load testing (not just for load balancing, but to test API throttling too)
- Look at using QUnit to develop our unit tests for our Backbone code
- Go back and write some functional tests, then set up Jenkins for CI
